Description: This package provides functions to perform development index (DVI) 
    modeling, a.k.a developmental rate (DVR) model. DVI models are 
    phenological models that simulate reproductive initiation and flowering of 
    crops, especially rice. Parameters of a DVI model can be estimated based on
    given climate information, sowing and heading dates of a variety. 
    Prediction of heading dates is then achieved using the DVI model with
    the estimated parameters and sowing dates.
